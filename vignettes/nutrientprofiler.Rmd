The `nutrientprofiler` package aims to provide a series of R functions that 
implement UK Nutrient Profiling Model scoring that can be applied across product 
datasets.

This is broken up into 3 parts within the package: 

- Specific gravity conversions
- Scoring the different nutritional components of the NPM score
- Calculating the NPM score and NPM assessment logic

```{r setup}
library(nutrientprofiler)
```
